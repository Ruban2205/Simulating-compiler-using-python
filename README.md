# Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this repository, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Ruban2205/Simulating-compiler-using-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory: 
```
cd Simulating-compiler-using-python
```

3. Each file mentioned above can be excuted independently. You can run them using a Python intrepreter or execute them directly from the command line.

4. Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. You can use these simulations as a starting point for building your own compiler or understanding the inner workings of different compiler components.
