# Simulating compiler using python üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the "Simulating Compiler using Python" respoitory! üéâ This repository contains a collection of Python code for simulating various components of a compiler. These components include token separation, symbol table generation, simulation of a macro processor, YAAC Programs, DFA Simulation, assembler simulation, predictive parser simulation, loader simulation, and intermediate code generator simulation.
