# Simulating compiler using python üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the "Simulating Compiler using Python" respoitory! üéâ This repository contains a collection of Python code for simulating various components of a compiler. These components include token separation, symbol table generation, simulation of a macro processor, YAAC Programs, DFA Simulation, assembler simulation, predictive parser simulation, loader simulation, and intermediate code generator simulation. 

## Topics üìÅ

This repository contains the following programs. 

1) [Token Seperation](/01_Token_seperation.ipynb)
2) [Symbol Table Generation](/02_Symbol_Table_Generation.ipynb)
3) [Simulation of Macro processor](/03_Simulation_of_Macro_Processor.ipynb)
4) [Simulation of DFA](/04_Simulation_of_Deterministic_Finate_Automaton.ipynb)
5) [Simulation of Assembler](/05_Simulation_of_Assembler.ipynb)
6) [Simulation of Predictive Parser](/06_Simulation_of_predictive_parser.ipynb)
7) [Simulation of Loader](/07_Simulation_of_Loader.ipynb)
8) [Simulation of Intermediate Code Generator](/08_Simulation_of_Intermediate_Code_Generation.ipynb)

# Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with this repository, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Ruban2205/Simulating-compiler-using-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory: 
```
cd Simulating-compiler-using-python
```

3. Each file mentioned above can be excuted independently. You can run them using a Python intrepreter or execute them directly from the command line.

4. Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs. You can use these simulations as a starting point for building your own compiler or understanding the inner workings of different compiler components.
